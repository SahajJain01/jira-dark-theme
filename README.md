# Jira Dark Theme

> Welcome to the dark side. Originally forked from radibit/jira-dark-theme

## Description

Simple Chrome extension, that applies dark theme to Jira. Edited from the original so that it isn't as jenky in the new jira style.

## Installation

Download the code or clone the repo, activate developer mode in `chrome://extensions`,
and load the extension using `Load unpacked extension`.

I don't have any plans to publish this extension at the moment.
