# Jira Dark Theme

> Welcome to the dark side. 

## Description

Simple Chrome extension that applies an inverted dark theme to Jira. Originally forked from radibit/jira-dark-theme. I edited from the original so that it isn't as jenky in the new jira style.

## Installation

Download the code or clone the repo, activate developer mode in `chrome://extensions`,
and load the extension using `Load unpacked extension`.

If you don't like the little jira icon you get in your extensions toolbar, right click it and hide it!
